The fork() function creates a child process that goes along with the parent/main 
process (2 processes in total) and they both execute the line of code, this 
function also returns an integer (may be used as an identifier for the process)
The child process' id is always 0, while the parent process' id can be another 
integer
Using two fork() functions actually creates a child process that creates by his
turn a child process
the fork() function, in a way, clones in the child process, all the previous 
processes each time it is called (visualisation of the call of fork() function
3 times [image-1])
