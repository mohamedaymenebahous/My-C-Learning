The pipe() function creates a pipe that acts like a bridge between two processes.

To work with pipes in C, we need to close the file descriptor before using write
or read functions, then we close the current file descriptor

********go back to Second_Program_test********

The mkfifo function creates a fifo file
This file can opened, written in, and read (like a pipe more or less)
The open function (from fnctl header file) return an important things 
which isan integer that represents a file descriptor
When opening a fifo file for writing only, it blocks the execution of
the c file, until it is opened for reading.

You can send and receive batches of data through fifos, like arrays, through
for loops, or directly by indicating the size of the array while using writing 
or reading functions
